# Studio UI - Streamlit

Built an end-user configurable Generative AI Studio, which can handle multiple input types, use various large language models (LLMs) locally or via an API, supports multiple speech-to-text models, etc.

It has three main components built with Python, the UI, the Middleware service and the LLM Service.

This repository has the code for UI with Streamlit.
